       				<p>Decision to invest a big amount is a huge task. Your financial security depends on how much you invest and how efficiently you do so. If the call goes wrong, the investor bears the opportunity loss to earn better returns. Investment planning is a financial product that provides the opportunity to create wealth for future.</p>
       				<p>Making plans first requires identification of goals. Financial Planning is not effective without first identifying objectives, whether short or long term.</p>
       				<p>At Vrishank Advisories we assist you in identifying your objectives and plan your finances accordingly. Diverse people have different objectives, and different objectives require varied approaches. Sit back with peace of mind while we manage your portfolio.</p>

       			<div class="Planning_item_info">
       				<p>In the personal finance book Rich Dad, Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki writes “It's not how much money you make, but how much money you keep, how hard it works for you, and how many generations you keep it for. “ It’s not enough just to create wealth but keeping it, saving it and letting you wealth grow by investing it.</p>
       				<p>Estate planning is critical to effectively preserve wealth and pass it on to the next generation. Estate planning is one of the most important steps to ensure that your final property and wealth distribution happens according to your will.</p>
       				<p>We can model the estate plan and monitor it year by year, adjusting it for changing financial circumstances, changing family, financial, and personal objectives and changes in tax laws.</p>
